# ProfileCoder & Open Profile Protocol (OPP) - Open Standards for Dynamic Professional Identity

Welcome to the repository developing the open standards **ProfileCoder** and **Open Profile Protocol (OPP)**! Our mission is to create foundations for a future-proof, interoperable, and user-centric ecosystem for professional identity management.

## Problem: Fragmentation and Limitations of Current Systems

Today's method of representing and exchanging data about competencies, experiences, and professional preferences is outdated. We rely on static CVs, scattered online profiles, and closed HR systems, leading to:

*   **Data fragmentation** and lack of a coherent picture of individual potential.
*   **Superficial matching** based on keywords rather than genuine understanding.
*   **Lack of interoperability** between key systems (ATS, e-learning platforms, HR tools).
*   **Limited user control** over personal data and privacy.

## Our Solution: Open Standards for the Future Ecosystem

We propose two complementary open standards to address these problems:

### 1. ProfileCoder: Data Format Standard

*   **What is it?** An open, text-based data format (inspired by vCard/iCalendar) designed for **rich, multidimensional, and contextual description of professional identity**.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Segmentation:** Logical division of data into segments (e.g., `üß†` Temperament, `üèÖ` Competencies, `üíº` Environment Preferences, `ü§ñ` AI Relationships) identified by unique symbols (emoji).
    *   **Structured Properties:** Data stored as key-value pairs within segments.
    *   **Context (`@`):** Ability to specify that a trait or preference applies to a specific situation (e.g., `@Team` vs `@Client`).
    *   **Weight (`^`):** Allows users to indicate the priority/importance of a given preference.
    *   **Extensibility:** Designed for easy addition of new segments/properties in the future.
    *   **Quantum Presence Interface (QPI):** Integration of static professional profiles with dynamic real-time presence states (new in v3.3).
*   **Current Version:** **v3.3** (Quantum Presence Integration)
*   **Full Specification:** [ProfileCoder v3.3 Specification](https://github.com/ProfilMatrix/profilecoder/blob/main/profilecoder-3.3.md)

### 2. Open Profile Protocol (OPP): Communication Standard

*   **What is it?** An open communication protocol defining a **secure and standardized way of interaction** between applications (OPP Clients) and personal professional data repositories (OPP Servers).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Client-Server Architecture:** Client sends requests, Server (controlled by the user) responds.
    *   **Security:** Enforced encryption (HTTPS/TLS), standard authentication mechanisms (OAuth 2.0).
    *   **User Control:** OPP Server owner manages access and granular permissions for Clients.
    *   **Interoperability:** Enables communication between different systems without dedicated integrations.
    *   **Standard Communication Format:** Based on JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP POST.
*   **Current Version:** **v1.0** - Full read/write capabilities with secure authentication.
*   **Full Specification:** [OPP v1.0 Specification](https://github.com/ProfilMatrix/opp/blob/main/opp-1.0.md)

## How It Works Together

1.  Users create and manage their rich professional profiles saved in the **ProfileCoder** format.
2.  These profiles are securely stored on their personal **OPP Server**.
3.  Users grant **consent** to selected applications (e.g., ATS systems, e-learning platforms), generating access keys and defining permissions within the **OPP** framework.
4.  These applications (acting as **OPP Clients**) can then securely communicate with the user's **OPP Server** using the **OPP** protocol to retrieve needed fragments of the **ProfileCoder** profile.
5.  This data can then be used by **AI** on the Client side for intelligent matching, personalization, analysis, etc.
6.  With the new **Quantum Presence Interface**, applications can also access and update dynamic presence states, enabling real-time collaboration and contextual interactions.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the **proposal phase**. We are focused on:

*   Refining the ProfileCoder and OPP specifications through community consultation.
*   Planning reference implementations for OPP Servers and Clients.
*   Developing libraries for parsing and creating ProfileCoder profiles.
*   Building a community around these standards.
*   Exploring practical applications in labor markets, smart cities, and cognitive environments.

## How You Can Participate

We are open to collaboration! You can help by:

*   **Reviewing Specifications:** Review the ProfileCoder and OPP specifications and submit your comments, suggestions, or identified ambiguities through our GitHub repository.
*   **Participating in Discussions:** Join conversations about standard development, use cases, and architecture in the community channels listed below.
*   **Implementing the Standards:** Start experimenting with implementing a ProfileCoder parser, OPP Client, or even your own OPP Server in your preferred technology. Share your experiences!
*   **Contributing Code (in the future):** When we release reference code, we welcome corrections and new functionalities through Pull Requests.
*   **Promotion:** Help us spread information about the ProfileCoder and OPP standards in your network.

## Timeline

- **April-June 2025**: Open consultation period
- **July 2025**: Review of feedback and revision of specifications
- **August 2025**: Pilot implementations with selected partners
- **Q4 2025**: Formal release of the standards, if sufficient consensus and validation have been achieved
